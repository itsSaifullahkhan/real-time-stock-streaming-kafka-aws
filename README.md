# real-time-stock-streaming-kafka-aws
Real-time stock market data pipeline using Apache Kafka and AWS services (EC2, S3, Glue, Athena).
This project simulates and processes real-time stock market data using Apache Kafka and AWS. A Python-based producer streams stock data to a Kafka broker hosted on EC2. A Kafka consumer ingests the data and writes it to Amazon S3. The pipeline is integrated with AWS Glue and Athena for schema detection and SQL-based analytics. Ideal for learning real-time data ingestion, ETL, and cloud-native analytics.
